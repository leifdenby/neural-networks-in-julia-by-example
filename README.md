# Hi!

This repository represents my journey through learning machine learning in
[julia](https://julialang.org/). I thought I'd turn my notes and code into
some interactive notebooks - maybe you will find them interesting or
useful ðŸ˜€

The notebooks are very much work-in-progress, but the idea is to implement
common techniques and architectures that you might come across when doing
machine learning.

You can have a look at the rendered notebooks (and even edit them
yourself!)
[here](https://leifdenby.github.io/neural-networks-in-julia-by-example/)

If you find any mistakes, typos, have suggestions etc please [raise an
issue or make
a pull-request](https://github.com/leifdenby/neural-networks-in-julia-by-example/issues).
Thank you! ðŸŽˆ
